  "The resilience-lane view makes it obvious which systems can absorb another board cycle and which ones still depend on a path that will snap under pressure.",

  "This view keeps AI, identity, revenue, procurement, FinTech, and biotech lanes tied to the exact failure point that would break the next board-facing packet.",

  "The reinforcement-posture view keeps handoff strain, failure proximity, escalation fragility, recovery weakness, and board-confidence loss in one scorecard.",
  "Weak tolerance remains visible before leadership assumes the path can absorb another burst of load.",
